            Dear Eileen,<br>
            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the
            University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr
                title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions
            one by one, in the following sections.
        </p>
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        <p>
            We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if
            you could start at the beginning of a semester, the start dates for each one are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: <time>9 September 2016</time> </li>

            <li>Third semester: <time>2 May 2017</time></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
